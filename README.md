# IP_address_bit_manipulation
This program prompts user to input 4 integers (similar to an IP address) and then output a value or values depending on user choice.

Example functionality: Enter and IP address:
192
168
1
5

Scenario 1: How would you like to see your IP address ((1) single value, (2) four values, (3), two values, (4) a single bit value): 

1 

Output should be 3232235781

Scenario 2: How would you like to see your IP address ((1) single value, (2) four values, (3), two values, (4) a single bit value): 
 
2

Output should be 192.168.1.5

Scenario 3: How would you like to see your IP address ((1) single value, (2) four values, (3), two values, (4) a single bit value): 

3

How many bits in the network address: 16

Output should be 49320, 261

Scenario 4: How would you like to see your IP address ((1) single value, (2) four values, (3), two values, (4) a single bit value): 

4

Which bit would you like to see: 21

Output should be 1
(Because the binary of the IP address is 1100000010 (**1**) 010000000000100000101)
